# auto-dehumidifier
An IoT solution for controlling/scheduling dehumidifier usage.

PURPOSE:

I was tired of having to turn my dehumidifier on/off whenever I felt it was humid in my downstairs pantry, so I decided to figure out a way to once again answer one of the most pressing questions in life:

"Can't someone else do it?" 
    - Homer Simpson

With IoT, it's always possible. Luckily, there are a handful of tutorials online that have been helpful in navigating my way around implementing this idea. Most of the credit should go to Tim Leland, who authoured a wonderful blog post and code about controlling remote controlled switches from a Raspberry Pi (https://github.com/timleland/rfoutlet).

HOW TO USE:
